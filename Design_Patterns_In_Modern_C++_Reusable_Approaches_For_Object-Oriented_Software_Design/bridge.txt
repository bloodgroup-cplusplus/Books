The bridge design pattern is connecting two components

The bridge prevents a 'Cartesian Product' complexity explosion

Example:
	Base class ThreadScheduler
	Can be preemptive or cooperative
	Can run on Windows or UNix



we don't rely on inhertitence 


Bridge : A mechanism that decouples an interface ( hierarchy) from and implemetation (hierarchy)
