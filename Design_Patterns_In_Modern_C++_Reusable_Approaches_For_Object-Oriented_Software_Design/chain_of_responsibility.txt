Motivation:
Let's imagine you are working for volskwagan
Someone behaves unethically 
So who takes the blame?
	* Employee
	* Manager 
If the manager knew about this it would be the department policy to know about it.
This is typical illustration for chain of responsibility.

Due to unethical behaviour from one percent it effects everyone all throughout the chain.

Say you click on a graphical element on a form ( a button )
	* Button handles it, stops further processing
	* The event doesn't go up the chain
	* Say the button is part of group box.
	* Window itself handle the event
	* So this is a chain of responsiblitly
	* say we have CCG Computer Game
	*And creature has attack and defencse values
	* Those can be boosted by other cards
	* This is chain of  responsibliity



Chain of Responsiblitly:
	A chain of components who all get a chance to process a command or a query, optionally haveing default processing implmentation and an ability to terminate the processing chain.
