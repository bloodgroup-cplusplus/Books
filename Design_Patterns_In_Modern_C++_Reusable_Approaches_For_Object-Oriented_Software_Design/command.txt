Motivation:
	Ordinary c++ statements are perishable
		Cannot undo a field/ property assignment
		Cannot directily serialize a sequence of actions(calls)
		We want that for auditing our actions.
		What we want to do is 

	We want an object that represents an operation
		X should change its field Y to the value Z
		X should do W()

	Uses: GUI commands, multi-level undo/redo, macro recording
	and morqE
	
Command : It is an object which represents an instruction to perform
a particualr action.  Contains all the information necessary for the
action to be taken.


Command Query Seperation

	Command= asking for an action or change ( e.g., please set your attack value to 2).

	We don't get a result at the end of it

	Query= Asking for information (e.g., please give me your attack vvalue).

	CQS= done in distributed databases ( having seperate means of sending commands and queries)

	There are lot of variations . 

	In Gang of Four context, both commands and queries are represetnted with the Command Design Pattern.


	Query is a manifestation of command design pattern.

	command design pattern encapsulates both command and query
