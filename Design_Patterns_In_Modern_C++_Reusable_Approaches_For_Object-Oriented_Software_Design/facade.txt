Facade:
	Exposing several components through a single interface.
	Making things convinient to end user.


Motivation:
	Balancing  complexity and presentation/usability
	Typical Home 
		It has many subsystesm (electrical, santiaion)
		Complex internal structre (e.g., floor layers)
		End user is not exposed to internals.
		We don't open the floors when we buy house.
		

	Same with software!
		Consumers of api just want something to work with
		Many systems workng to provide flexibility but..
		API consumers want it to just work

		we don't need to worry about buffers buffer overruns.
		We only work with public interface.


Facade: Provides a simple, easy to understand/ user interface over a large and 
sophisticated body of code.
