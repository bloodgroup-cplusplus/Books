f we've got a bunch of classes and there are bunch of interactions between
those things.

some level of arbitary connections


If we have a client ( a user of a particular piece of code)


If the client wants to use these in particular manner


we can have a lot of classes that each do one thing only ( singleton)


there are lots of different classes.

Depending on the complexity of classes


A bunch of classes you would use to seperate things into classes.

Have this high level of abstrcation.


In order to do any useful  work.

In order to do any compilation of problem we could use a lot of classes at the same time.


In order to instatntiate these things we can pass it through it.


Depending on the scenario we might have lot of wiriings.


Depending on the model it might be non-trival to use some data structures.

what is facade ?

It's fine to do complex wiring there is an easy way of doing it.

Facade is the exterior of the builidng.

House is a lot more than a facade

Underneath the facade we have a lot of plumming.


We create a facade. Instaed we create a facade which interacts with all of the wiring.

The facade does all of the complex wiring with the

the point is that we construct a facade that interacts with object and simplifies the interaction with you.

If we imagine we have multiple clients.
