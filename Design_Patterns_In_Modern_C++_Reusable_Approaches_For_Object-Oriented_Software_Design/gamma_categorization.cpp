Gamma Categorization

* Design patterns are typically split into three categories
* This is called Gamma categorization after Erich Gamma, one of GOF authors
* Creational Patterns
* 	Deal with creation (construction) of objects
* 	Explicit(consturctor) vs implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
	DI reflection etc is implicit object creation (DI= dependency injection)
	Wholsale (single statement ) vs piecewise (step-by-step)
	Several steps to be taken before object is need to be used


*Structural Patterns
	* Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
	* Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface
	* Stress the importance of good API desing
	*
* Behavioural Patterns
* 	They don't really follow any central theme.
* 	They solve it in a particualr way
