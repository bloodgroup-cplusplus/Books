Some objects are simple and can be created in a single constructor
call

other objects require a lot of ceremony to create

Having an object with 10 constructor arguemtns is not productive

If you have constructors with too much argument it will generate false sense of security

Instead opt for piecewise construction

Builder: When piecewise object construction is complicated provide an API for doing it succinctly.
