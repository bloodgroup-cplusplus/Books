1) What are design patterns?
	Designed patterns are common architectural approches

2) popularized by the Gang of Four book (1994) smalltalk and C++

3) We now have modern C++ (take those design patterns in modern C++)

4) Translated to many oops languages C#, Java... and plenty of languages and JS

5) Design patterns are universally relavant.. They became so popular that they were internalized in some languages.

6) Obsserver pattern is now a keyword in C# as 'event' . Even java has the event

7) We certainly can implement patterns ourselves.

8) If we are not aware of design patterns we make use of it unknowingly
