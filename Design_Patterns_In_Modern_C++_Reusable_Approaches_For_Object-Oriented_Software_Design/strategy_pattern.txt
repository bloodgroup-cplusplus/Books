Strategy Pattern

* Simplest Pattern

* It's about using composition rather than inheritence.

* Official Def : Defines a family of algorithms ( when we are using strategy we have family of algorithms ) each of them are interchangable.

* We can plug and play in case of stragtegy pattern. Strategy lets the algorithm vary from the  client using it.


* Whoever is using the algorithm are the client. The client doesn't have to vary if the algorithm varies.


* To change the algorithm we need not need to change the client


* in the example there is a duck class



*  the subclasses ducks are responsible for implementing own version of display method.
