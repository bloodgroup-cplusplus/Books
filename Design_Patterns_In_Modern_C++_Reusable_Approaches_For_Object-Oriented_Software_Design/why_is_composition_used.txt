objects use other object's fields/ properties/ members through inheritence and composition

composition lets us make compound objects.

	e.g., a mathematical expression compsed of simple expressions; or
		a grouping of shapes that consists of several shapes.


Composite design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) and composite objects uniformly


	i.e., Foo and Collection< Foo> have compositions




Composite = A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a unifrom manner.
