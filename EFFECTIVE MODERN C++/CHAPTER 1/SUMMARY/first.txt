Type deduction for templates is the basis for one of modern C++'s most compelling features:
AUTO
When the template type deduction rules are applied in the context of auto, they
sometimes seem less intuitive than when they're applied to templates.
It's good to understand the aspects of template type deduction that auto builds on.
